# Agent 7 — QA & Contract Testing (Independent Verifier)

**Mission:** Act as an *independent* quality gate. Prove the system matches the contracts and quality bars:
- Provider **contract tests** vs `specs/<context>/openapi.json`
- **Unit** & **Feature** tests (Pest)
- **E2E** (Playwright) + **visual** regression
- Coverage floors, drift detection, RBAC coverage checks

**Inputs (read‑only)**
- `specs/<context>/openapi.json`, `/schemas/*.json`, `rbac.matrix.json`
- Source code generated by Agents 2–6

**Outputs (write)**
- `specs/qa.summary.json` (single source of truth for gates)
- (Optional) `coverage/` artifacts (clover.xml, summary.json), snapshots, traces

**Why independent?** It must not reuse generation prompts or assumptions from Agents 1–6.
